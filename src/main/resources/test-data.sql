					<p>Evangelical Mission and Seminary International (E.M.S.I.)
						was established by the founder, Rev. Moses Yang, in 1968 after
						"Fellowship of Life" was started. Later it progressively developed
						into a global evangelical organization. At the present, we have
						established Gospel ministries in four continents - Europe, Asia,
						North America, and Africa. The Christian Evangelical Mission was
						established in West Orange, New Jersey in 1975. And the
						Evangelical Mission and Seminary International was established in
						Towaco, New Jersey in 1982. In these forty years (1968-2008), the
						ministry had expanded to seminaries, churches, mission,
						literature, and broadcasting, etc. We have a biblically sound
						Statement of Faith, a clear administrative organization and a
						strong three-fold Gospel ministry. Through the multi-faceted
						ministry, the Gospel could spread far and wide.</p>
